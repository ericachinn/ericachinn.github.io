    <p class="byline">by Dorothy Ma, Erica Chin, Sammi Chan</p>
    <p>Care homes for the disabled in Hong Kong dragged their feet in improving the facilities and fire safety by manipulating the renewal of an alternative licence, the Certificate of Exemption (the certificate).</p>
    <p>The promise made by the government to put an end to the certificate by the end of 2019 did not halt such operations, only expedited the game. </p>
    <p>For six private residential homes in Sham Shui Po or Tai Po district whose certificates has expired on March 31 and due to meet the licensing requirements, four of them simply put up a renewed Certificate of Exemption on April 1 right way and go on to linger, the reporters found.</p>
    <p>One of the failed nursery homes, Home Of Good Shepherd Limited in Cheung Sha Wan, was expected to start its improvement a year ago but the construction is not going to happen until this May, the director Mr.Lau told the reporters.</p>
    <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1tRlmvtuZ1vSSOTsx3R-wJkGb6sKx3_5b" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
    <p>The certificate is only granted to homes opened before November 18 in 2011, the day when the <a href = "https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap613">Residential Care Homes (Persons with Disabilities) Ordinance, Cap. 613</a> went to effective, if they were not on a par with the licencing requirements stipulated in the ordinance. </p>
    <p>That is to say, the disabled homes still holding a certificate today were given in total more than seven years to improve their conditions and such dilly-dally has been well covered by the system.</p>
    <p>Although the <a href ="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap613">ordinance</a> rules a certificate can only last for up to thirty-six months and most of certificates held by private homes are valid for twelve months as reporters found in February, there is no restriction on how many times it can be renewed.</p>
    <p>The government has the vision to make all certificate holders meet the licensing requirements by the end of 2019, said Vivian Siu, the senior information officer from Social Welfare Department in a written reply to the reporters.
        </p>
    <p>However, 152 disabled homes in Hong Kong still operate with the certificate by the end of March, leaving them nine months away from the deadline, according to Carol Ip, the Director of Social Welfare, who gave the figure on a <a href="https://webcast.legco.gov.hk/public/en-us/SearchResult?MeetingID=M19040064">panel</a> on welfare service in legislative council on April 15. </p>    
    <p>These homes of disabled may renew their certificates for the last time, but then comes another concern: with a short timeframe to upgrade, the rush is anything but a good news for the current residents during the renovation.</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "subheading">Government liaison lengthens improvement plans</p>
    <p>With just six months planned to finish the project which the home failed to complete in years, the person in charge of Home Of Good Shepherd Limited, Mr. Ma, sounds confident in meeting the deadline. </p>
    <p>“If they (the Social Welfare Department) have approved the renovation plan, we will be granted the license as long as we follow the improvement steps,” said Mr. Ma.</p>
    <p>Home Of Good Shepherd Limited is one of the private care homes who is holding a <a href="https://www.swd.gov.hk/storage/asset/section/3011/2019/D0234_01042019.pdf">Certificate of Exemption</a>, which was issued immediately after its <a href="https://www.swd.gov.hk/storage/asset/section/3011/2018/D0234_01042018.pdf">previous one</a> expired in the end of March, allowing him another seven months for the improvement after a twelve-month period.</p>
    <p>When asked why the project was not up to scratch during the past period, the man attributed the delay to the time-consuming administration works with the government.</p>
